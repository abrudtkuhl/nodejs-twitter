# NodeJS / Twitter

Implement a node app that prompts user from a search query and use it to
stream related live tweets.

For my edification, I will use this as an opportunity to learn Express
and display the tweets on the browser.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jsurdilla/nodejs-twitter.git

CD into it:

    $ cd nodejs-twitter

Run it!

    $ node app.js

By defaul it will run on port 3000. Just open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and type in a query (hint: choose a common word to see results quickly.)
